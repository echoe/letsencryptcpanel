Hi! This is a repository to install let's encrypt SSL certificates onto a cPanel server with shell scripts. :)
This is outmoded as cPanel made their own let's encrypt plugin. I would recommend using that.
If you want to know more about how to write scripts to use cPanel's CLI or anything like that, you can look at this anyways!
